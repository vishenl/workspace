    <h2>Do This Right Now:</h2>
    <div class="callout-box">
        <p><strong>Think about the last mistake you made.</strong></p>
        <p>Now notice what your inner voice said about it.</p>
        <p>Would you EVER talk to someone you love the way you just talked to yourself?</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 1.1em; color: #667eea;">
            <strong>If not, why do you allow yourself to be treated this way?</strong>
        </p>
    </div>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-top: 30px;">
        You're exhausted. Burned out. You've lost touch with who you really are underneath all the roles you play.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
        You've tried meditation apps. Self-help books. Maybe therapy. And still, the overwhelm doesn't stop.
    </p>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
        <strong>Because no one told you the real problem:</strong> You're in an abusive relationship. With yourself.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- THE ONE PROBLEM MECHANISM -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>What if everything changes when you fix ONE relationship?</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 1.15em; line-height: 1.8;">
        Self-Reset is a one-day immersive experience that does what no book, app, or therapy session has done:
        <strong>It reveals how you betray yourself every single day—and gives you the tools to stop.</strong>

        <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">
            By the end of January 18th, you will:<br><br>
            ✓ See exactly how you sabotage your own success (and why)<br>
            ✓ Understand the difference between self-care and self-love (they're not the same)<br>
            ✓ Break up with self-betrayal—without fanfare or drama<br>
            ✓ Learn to love yourself when you're LEAST lovable (that's when it matters most)<br>
            ✓ Walk away with practical tools that work at home, not just in a seminar room

    <h2>Why This Works When Everything Else Failed</h2>

    <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>1. No Spiritual Bypass</h3>
            <p>Kristina's no-BS approach means no platitudes, no toxic positivity, no "just love yourself more" nonsense. This is the real inner work you've been avoiding.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>2. Science + Experience</h3>
            <p>Knowledge alone changes nothing. This isn't a lecture—it's an immersive experience designed to rewire your brain through the three pillars: knowledge, experience, and reflection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>3. One Day, One Focus</h3>
            <p>Not another 6-week program you'll abandon. One intensive day to solve the ONE problem causing all your other problems. Then you take the tools home and your real life changes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>4. Built for Skeptics</h3>
            <p>If you're rolling your eyes at "self-love" talk, good. Kristina is known for engaging even the most vehement skeptics. She'll earn your trust with critical thinking, not fairy dust.</p>

<!-- THE 5 TRANSFORMATIONS -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>The 5 Shifts That Change Everything</h2>

    <h3>1. Stop Sabotaging Your Own Success</h3>
    <p>The hard truth: Your problems in business, relationships, and health aren't external. They're symptoms of your fractured relationship with yourself. We'll show you how to shift perspective and finally see light on the other side.</p>

    <h3>2. Stop Fighting for Time</h3>
    <p>Self-love isn't a ritual or daily practice that requires time. It's a relationship. You'll learn the critical difference between self-care and self-love, and stop feeling guilty about "not having time."</p>

    <h3>3. Understand What Self-Love Actually Is</h3>
    <p>Worried about becoming selfish or narcissistic? Good news: Narcissism isn't too much self-love—it's a distortion of it. You'll learn how to be your most loyal cheerleader AND your best support, no matter what life throws at you.</p>

    <h3>4. Break Up With Self-Betrayal</h3>
    <p>True authenticity isn't about "dropping filters" and being rude. It's about giving up self-betrayal. You'll discover exactly how you betray yourself every day—and how to stop this destructive pattern civilly, without fanfare.</p>

    <h3>5. Love Yourself When It's Hardest</h3>
    <p>Right now you might rate your self-love at 7 or 8. But what about when you fail? When you disappoint yourself? That's when you need your own love most—and when it's hardest to give. We'll teach you how.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>One Day. Three Transformational Phases.</h2>

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin-bottom: 30px;">
        This isn't a conference where you sit and listen. This is an immersive experience built on the three pillars of lasting transformation: <strong>Knowledge + Experience + Reflection</strong>.
    </p>

    <div class="schedule-timeline">
        <div class="schedule-item">
            <p class="schedule-time">10:00 AM - 12:00 PM EET</p>
            <h3>Phase 1: Finding Clarity</h3>
            <p>Do you really love yourself? Or only when you "deserve" it? We start by cutting through the facade and finding clarity about your real relationship status with yourself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-item">
            <p class="schedule-time">1:00 PM - 3:00 PM EET</p>
            <h3>Phase 2: Reprogramming</h3>
            <p>Is it self-love or narcissism? Self-care or coping? We'll dive deep into your beliefs and help you reprogram the buggy software making self-love feel impossible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-item">
            <p class="schedule-time">4:00 PM - 6:00 PM EET</p>
            <h3>Phase 3: Empowering</h3>
            <p>You'll learn and practice powerful tools to make self-love your default state. Imagine redirecting all the energy you waste fighting yourself into something that actually matters. That's where you're headed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="schedule-item">

<!-- WHAT MAKES IT DIFFERENT -->
<div class="section">
    <h2>What Makes Self-Reset Different from Everything You've Tried</h2>

    <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>Build the Inner Framework First</h3>
            <p>Before diving deeper, you'll learn foundational skills to accelerate personal growth in ANY area of life. It's like learning the alphabet before reading—you need it no matter what comes next.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>Experience Changes Perception</h3>
            <p>Knowledge doesn't change anything. Your life changes when your PERCEPTION changes. Experience brings knowledge from your brain into your heart—that's what creates transformation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>Process to Rewire Your Brain</h3>
            <p>Experience alone doesn't work either. "What doesn't kill you" can leave you broken. You need a framework to process experiences in an empowering way. That's what rewires your brain for success.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>Tools for Everyday Life</h3>
            <p>Your life doesn't change at an event. It changes at home, in the office, in mundane everyday circumstances. You'll get practical tools to take this wisdom back into your real life. And change it. For good.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>No-Bullshit Approach</h3>
            <p>Kristina is known for dropping pretenses and admitting when things don't look right. Her natural inquisitiveness and scientific approach engage even the most vehement skeptics.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="feature-box">
            <h3>Community That Gets It</h3>
            <p>Mindvalley attracts extraordinary people who understand transformation requires community. Your chances at lasting change are much greater with a caring, supportive community to lean on.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Questions You Might Have</h2>

    <h3>What's the time commitment?</h3>
    <p>One day. January 18, 2026, from 10 AM to 6 PM EET. Plus an optional book signing session during the break. That's it.</p>

    <h3>Will this work for me if I'm skeptical about "self-love" stuff?</h3>
    <p>Especially then. Kristina is known for engaging skeptics. This isn't woo-woo—it's a no-BS, science-backed approach to fixing the relationship that matters most.</p>

    <h3>I've tried therapy, books, courses. Why would this be different?</h3>
    <p>Because those focused on symptoms (anxiety, burnout, relationship problems). This addresses the root cause: your relationship with yourself. Fix the ONE problem, and the other 99 symptoms shift.</p>

    <h3>What if I can't make it or change my mind?</h3>
    <p>Full refund up to 10 days before the event (January 8, 2026). No questions, no hassle. Email support@kristinamand.com and you're done.</p>

    <h3>Can I transfer my ticket to someone else?</h3>
    <p>Yes. Tickets can be transferred to family or friends. Email support@kristinamand.com one week before the event to arrange transfer.</p>

    <h3>Do I need a visa to enter Estonia?</h3>
    <p>Depends on your nationality. Check official visa requirements at <a href="https://vm.ee/en/consular-visa-and-travel-information/visa-information/who-does-not-need-visa-visit-estonia" target="_blank">Estonia's government website</a>.</p>

    <h3>Is the book signing included?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Every ticket includes a signed copy of "Becoming Flawesome." If you want a personalized signature or want to bring your own copy for signing, join the Meet & Greet session during the break.</p>

    <h3>What's NOT included in the ticket?</h3>
    <p>Accommodation, travel, and personal expenses. You're responsible for booking your own hotel and getting to Tallinn. (But the city center is only 15 minutes from anywhere, so logistics are easy!)</p>
