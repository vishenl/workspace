Hey [First Name],

I need to tell you about something I've been planning for months.

This December, I'm doing something I've never done before.

I'm hosting an intimate 7-day voyage through Southern Spain aboard a private yacht—and I want you there with me.

**December 13-20, 2025.**

Not a massive cruise ship with thousands of people. A private yacht. Just 312 guests. Casual luxury. The Mediterranean in winter.

Here's what I'm envisioning:

🧘 **Two exclusive 90-minute sessions** I've never taught publicly before—mastering 6 Phase Meditation and architecting your most powerful 2026

⛵ **Seven days sailing through** Barcelona, Valencia, Gibraltar, Málaga, Cartagena, and Palma de Mallorca

🌅 **Daily yoga, meditation, and breathwork** as the Spanish coastline glides by

✨ **An intimate community** of 311 other growth-minded souls who truly get it

🍷 **All-inclusive casual luxury**—unlimited WiFi, premium drinks, gourmet dining, excursions, gratuities (no hidden fees)

But here's why I'm really doing this:

**2025 is almost over.**

Most people will stumble into 2026 exhausted, with vague resolutions and recycled goals.

But what if you ended this year differently?

What if you took seven days to **powerfully reflect on 2025**, extract its lessons, release what no longer serves you—and then **intentionally architect 2026** with clarity, purpose, and vision?

That's what this voyage is about.

**Not another event. A complete reset.**

I'll personally guide you through:

✅ **Session 1:** Mastering the 6 Phase Meditation practice (never taught this deeply before)
✅ **Session 2:** Designing your 2026 vision using frameworks from *The Code of the Extraordinary Mind*

Between sessions? We'll explore Gaudí's Barcelona, Gibraltar's Rock, Palma's crystal waters. We'll practice yoga on the deck at sunrise. We'll sip wellness elixirs and have conversations that change everything.

**This isn't for everyone.**

It's for you if:
- You're 40+ and take your growth seriously
- You can pick up and go (passport required, international travelers welcome)
- You invest in experiences that truly transform you
- You value intimate connections over massive crowds
- You're ready to close 2025 powerfully and start 2026 intentionally

With only 312 spots on this private yacht, it'll fill fast.

**Here's the investment:**

🚢 **Base Voyage:** Starting at $4,399+ per person (double occupancy)
All-inclusive casual luxury—everything covered.

💎 **Premium Experience:** +$250 (only 25 spots)
Includes exclusive meet & greet, group dinner with me, signed book.

👑 **VIP Experience:** +$500 (only 8 spots)
Intimate 10-seat communal table with me, extended private time, VIP gift package.

I know December feels soon. But that's exactly the point.

**The best transformations happen when you say yes before you're "ready."**

So here's my invitation:

Join me in Spain.

Let's close out 2025 together. Let's design the most extraordinary 2026 of your life.

Let's set sail.
