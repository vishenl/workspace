# Soul Collection A/B Tests - Ready for Implementation 🚀

Hey team!

I've completed TWO complete A/B test packages for Soul Collection subscription optimization:

1. **Duality Masterclass Funnel** - For users coming from Jeffrey Allen's energy work webinar
2. **Silva Ultramind Funnel** - For users coming from the 30+ minute Silva video with Vishen

Both packages solve the same conversion challenge: **users want ONE specific program, but we're offering them a subscription to 21 programs instead.**

The Silva funnel is actually MORE challenging because the video is deeply program-specific, mentions a different price point ($1.50/day), and promises specific techniques and bonuses.

## 📦 What's Inside

# 🧘 DUALITY MASTERCLASS FUNNEL

**Three files ready to deploy:**

### 1️⃣ **Duality Variation A** - "Subscription as Smart Choice"
**Strategy:** Show the value comparison EARLY (Section 2, right after hero)

**Link:** https://vishenl.github.io/workspace/campaigns/soul-collection/soul-collection-var-a.html

**Psychology:** Pre-emptive objection handling. We address "I only want Duality" immediately by showing them it's the SAME PRICE for 21 programs. No brainer.

**Best for:** Analytical buyers, comparison shoppers, value-conscious decision makers

---

### 2️⃣ **Duality Variation B** - "Subscription as Upgrade"
**Strategy:** Build desire for Duality FIRST, then show comparison (Section 4)

**Link:** https://vishenl.github.io/workspace/campaigns/soul-collection/soul-collection-var-b.html

**Psychology:** Desire-first approach. Let them fall in love with Duality, explain why one program isn't enough for spiritual growth, THEN show them the collection is the same price.

**Best for:** Emotional buyers, committed spiritual seekers, growth-oriented mindset

# 🧠 SILVA ULTRAMIND FUNNEL

**Three files ready to deploy:**

### 1️⃣ **Silva Variation A** - "Subscription as Smart Choice"
**Strategy:** Show the value comparison EARLY (Section 2, right after hero)

**Link:** https://vishenl.github.io/workspace/campaigns/soul-collection/silva-ultramind-var-a.html

**Psychology:** Pre-emptive objection handling. Address "I only want Silva" immediately by showing them it's the SAME PRICE for 21 programs.

**Silva-Specific Features:**
- Price clarification box (addresses "$1.50/day" from video vs actual $299/year)
- All promised Silva techniques (Mental Screen, 3 Scenes, Mental Video, Centering Exercise)
- Creative Visualization bonus with Lisa Nichols prominently featured
- Success stories from the video (Helen Hadsell, Richard Bach)

**Best for:** Analytical buyers, comparison shoppers, value-conscious decision makers

---

### 2️⃣ **Silva Variation B** - "Subscription as Upgrade"
**Strategy:** Build desire for Silva FIRST, explain multi-program benefits, THEN show comparison (Section 4)

**Link:** https://vishenl.github.io/workspace/campaigns/soul-collection/silva-ultramind-var-b.html

**Psychology:** Sequential persuasion. Let them fall in love with Silva, educate them why spiritual growth needs multiple modalities (Silva teaches altered states, other programs teach what to DO in those states), then reveal the collection is the same price.

**Unique to Var B:**
- "Why Silva is Just the Beginning" journey section
- Explains how Silva synergizes with other programs (Superbrain, Energy Medicine, Duality)
- Builds understanding that transformation needs multiple tools

**Best for:** Emotional buyers, committed spiritual seekers, growth-oriented mindset

---

### 3️⃣ **Silva Implementation Guide** - Complete Testing Documentation
**Your playbook for running this test successfully**

**Link:** https://vishenl.github.io/workspace/campaigns/soul-collection/silva-ultramind-implementation-guide.html

**Includes:**
- Silva-specific conversion challenges (price discrepancy, technique continuity, bonus expectations)
- How we addressed each challenge
- Message continuity from 30+ minute video to landing page
- Analytics event tracking (including silva-specific events)
- User journey walkthrough for both variations
- Success metrics and statistical significance requirements
- Pre-launch checklist
- Troubleshooting guide specific to Silva funnel

**Critical Silva Context:**
The Silva video goes DEEP into specific techniques and promises. Users expect:
- Mental Screen Technique (visualize with 5 senses)
- 3 Scenes Technique (program subconscious)
- Mental Video Technique (Delta level insights)
- Centering Exercise (22-minute Alpha level audio)
- Creative Visualization bonus ($249 value)
- Pricing mentioned as "$1.50/day"

If they don't see these EXACT elements on the landing page, they'll feel bait-and-switched. Both variations deliver on all promises while expanding to the full collection.

## 🎯 What We're Testing (Both Funnels)

**Test Variable #1:** Information architecture - when do we show the comparison?
- Var A: Section 2 (early, pre-emptive)
- Var B: Section 4 (late, after desire is built)

**Test Variable #2:** Offer framing psychology
- Var A: "Smart choice" (you'd be silly not to take this)
- Var B: "Smart upgrade" (natural next step in your journey)

## 🔑 The Core Insight

### Duality Funnel Challenge:

In the Duality webinar, Jeffrey Allen talks about:
- Awakening your energy body
- Sensing and moving energy in your chakras
- Living between physical and spiritual realms
- Using energy work in daily life

**The problem:** Users leave that webinar thinking "I want to learn THIS - Duality."

**How we address it:**
✅ **Duality is prominently featured** - They see it's included, front and center
✅ **Comparison table shows same price** - Why wouldn't you get 20 more programs?
✅ **Journey enhancement section** (Var B) - Explains why spiritual growth needs multiple modalities
✅ **FAQ directly addresses** "What if I only want Duality?" - No pressure, focus on what you want

### Silva Funnel Challenge (HARDER):

In the 30+ minute Silva video, Vishen talks about:
- Jose Silva's discovery of accessing Alpha brainwave states
- Mental Screen Technique (visualize with all 5 senses)
- 3 Scenes Technique (program your subconscious)
- Mental Video Technique (access Delta level for insights)
- Helen Hadsell winning contests using Silva Method
- Richard Bach writing Jonathan Livingston Seagull with these techniques
- Promises Creative Visualization bonus ($249 value)
- Mentions "$1.50/day" pricing

**The problem:** Users leave that video with VERY SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS. They want those exact techniques, that bonus, and that price point.

**How we address it:**
✅ **All promised techniques listed** - Mental Screen, 3 Scenes, Mental Video, Centering Exercise
✅ **Creative Visualization bonus prominently featured** - "As promised in the video"
✅ **Price clarification box** - Transparent about "$1.50/day" mention vs actual $299/year (which is BETTER at $0.82/day)
✅ **Success stories from video** - Helen Hadsell, Richard Bach referenced
✅ **Message continuity** - Every promise from the video is fulfilled on the page

**Our challenge for both:** Get them to see Soul Collection subscription as the better choice, not a different offer.

## 🧠 Psychology Behind The Changes

### What We REMOVED from var110:

❌ **Generic social proof** ("20M students")
**Why:** Users already trust Mindvalley. That's not the friction point.

❌ **Platform features** (mobile app, offline access)
**Why:** These are table stakes. Doesn't address "why subscription vs one program?"

❌ **"How it works" section**
**Why:** Users understand how subscriptions work. The question is "why should I?"

❌ **Generic testimonials**
**Why:** Need subscription-specific social proof (e.g., "I only wanted one program but now I use 5!")

### What We ADDED:

✅ **Enhanced comparison table**
**Why:** Makes the value gap CRYSTAL clear. Same price, 20x more programs.

✅ **Journey enhancement section** (Var B only)
**Why:** Educates users that spiritual transformation needs multiple approaches, not just one program.

✅ **2,000% value highlight**
**Why:** Quantifies the savings. $6,279 value for $299 = 95% off.

✅ **Subscription-specific FAQ**
**Why:** Directly addresses the "I only want one" objection without being pushy.

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Conservative estimate:** 15-20% lift in subscription conversion
**Optimistic estimate:** 25-35% lift

**Why this should work:**
1. Both variations directly address the core objection
2. Comparison table makes the value gap impossible to ignore
3. We're not hiding the subscription—we're explaining why it's the smart choice
4. Message continuity from Duality webinar → landing page

---

## ✅ Pre-Launch Checklist

Before you hit go, make sure:

- [ ] Pricing is accurate ($299/year)
- [ ] 15-day guarantee language matches policy
- [ ] All CTAs link to correct checkout flow
- [ ] Analytics events are set up (see implementation guide)
- [ ] A/B testing tool is configured (50/50 split)
- [ ] Test on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Legal/compliance has reviewed copy

---

## 🚦 How to Run the Test

**Recommended approach:**

1. **Soft launch:** Start with 10% traffic for 24-48 hours (catch any bugs)
2. **Monitor closely:** Check bounce rate, conversion rate, no technical issues
3. **Ramp up:** If all good, go to 50/50 split
4. **Let it run:** Minimum 2 weeks OR until you hit 95% statistical significance
5. **Analyze:** Use the implementation guide for statistical analysis

**Don't stop early!** I've seen teams kill tests after 3 days when they see early trends. Wait for significance.

## 💡 What We'll Learn

This test tells us:
- Do users need value proof upfront (Var A) or desire-building first (Var B)?
- Does "smart choice" or "smart upgrade" framing resonate better?
- What's the optimal information architecture for subscription offers?

**Even if one variation "loses"**, we'll learn what doesn't work and can iterate from there.

---

## 📞 Questions?

The implementation guide has extensive troubleshooting, but if you hit any issues:

**Common issues covered:**
- Low traffic → how to get more visitors
- High bounce rate → traffic source quality issues
- Conversions dropping → potential technical problems
- Results fluctuating → sample size and timing issues

**Key resources in implementation guide:**
- Analytics event tracking code examples
- Statistical significance calculator recommendations
- Follow-up test ideas based on results
- Mobile optimization tips

## 🎯 Bottom Line

We built FOUR strategic variations across TWO funnels that directly address why users hesitate to subscribe when they only want one program. All are production-ready, fully responsive, and use Mindvalley's design system.

**The Psychology:**
- **Variation A (both funnels):** "Here's the value comparison—you'd be silly to choose less."
- **Variation B (both funnels):** "Fall in love with [program], then discover the full collection is smarter."

One variation will win for Duality. One will win for Silva. Let's find out which. 🚀
