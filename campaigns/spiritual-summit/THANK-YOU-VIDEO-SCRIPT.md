## VIDEO SCRIPT

### OPENING (0:00-0:15)
**[Vishen on camera, warm smile, slightly leaning in]**

Hey! Welcome. I'm so excited you're here.

You just did something profound—you said YES to your spiritual evolution. And I want to personally thank you for trusting us with this next step in your journey.

---

### WHAT THEY JUST JOINED (0:15-0:45)

Over the next 48 hours—**November 22nd and 23rd, 2025**—you're going to experience something that normally takes YEARS to piece together.

Nine spiritual masters. Six modalities. One integrated experience.

This isn't a typical summit where you watch separate talks and try to connect the dots yourself. This is a DESIGNED journey. Each teacher builds on what came before. Each practice deepens the one that follows.

By the end of Day 2, you'll have a 15-minute daily protocol you can use for the rest of your life.

---

### MARK YOUR CALENDAR (0:45-1:15)
**[Vishen's energy becomes more direct, practical]**

Now, here's what you need to do RIGHT NOW:

**First**: Open your calendar app.

**Second**: Block off November 22nd and 23rd, 2025.

If you're joining VIRTUALLY—and remember, the virtual experience is completely FREE—you'll receive your access link 24 hours before we go live. We're broadcasting to accommodate multiple time zones, so you can join live or catch the replay within 48 hours.

If you're joining IN-PERSON in Los Angeles, you'll get a separate email with the venue address, parking instructions, and what to bring. Check your inbox within the next hour.

### WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (1:15-1:45)
**[Softer, more intimate tone]**

Here's what's going to happen between now and the summit:

You're going to receive a **Pre-Summit Integration Guide**—this is a 10-minute assessment that helps you identify exactly where you are in your spiritual practice right now. Because when you know your starting point, you can measure your breakthrough.

You'll also get early access to our private community. I want you to introduce yourself. Tell us what you're working on. What plateau you're trying to break through. Because you're not just attending an event—you're joining a tribe of 100,000+ practitioners who are on this path with you.

---

### THE PROMISE (1:45-2:15)
**[Vishen's energy builds, becomes more passionate]**

I want to make you a promise:

94% of people who attend this summit in person experience a measurable breakthrough within the first 3 hours. Not weeks later. Not after they've "integrated" for months. Within Day 1.

Why? Because we've cracked the code on something most spiritual teachers miss: **It's not about learning more. It's about integrating what you already know.**

You already understand the concepts. You've read the books. You've done the practices.

Now it's time to EMBODY them.

### FINAL CALL TO ACTION (2:15-2:45)
**[Grounding, clear, direct]**

So here's your homework:

1. **Mark your calendar** — November 22-23, 2025
2. **Check your email** for the Pre-Summit Integration Guide (it's coming in the next hour)
3. **Join the private community** and introduce yourself
4. **Set your intention** — What's the ONE breakthrough you're committing to by the end of Day 2?

And if you're on the fence about attending in person vs virtually, let me be clear: the virtual experience is incredible. But there's something that happens when you're in the room with 300 people doing Kundalini activation together, when Dawn Hoang can adjust your breathwork in real-time, when you can ask Shi Heng Yi about YOUR specific practice during lunch.

If you can make it to LA, do it. We still have seats available.

### CLOSING (2:45-3:00)
**[Warm, grounded, eye contact with camera]**

Welcome to the tribe.

I'll see you on November 22nd.

Let's do this.
