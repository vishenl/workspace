            <div class="copyable-content">
                <p>Hey there,</p>

                <p>So... you made it.</p>

                <p>Five months ago, you walked into Manifesting Mastery with a mix of curiosity, hope, and maybe a touch of skepticism. (It's okay—I get it. I was skeptical about this stuff too before I experienced it firsthand.)</p>

                <p>Maybe you were wondering: "Is this manifestation thing actually real? Or am I just fooling myself?"</p>

                <p>Maybe you'd tried vision boards and affirmations before and thought, "Yeah, that didn't work."</p>

                <p>Or maybe—just maybe—you had this quiet knowing deep inside that whispered: <em>There's something more here. I just need to figure out how to unlock it.</em></p>

                <p>Well, here's what I want you to know today:</p>

                <p><strong>You didn't just figure it out. You lived it.</strong></p>

                <p>You're not the same person who started this journey. You're someone who now <em>knows</em>—not hopes, not wishes, but <strong>knows</strong>—that manifestation works. Because you've seen it happen in your own life.</p>

                <p>Let me tell you what you've actually accomplished over these past five months (because sometimes we forget to give ourselves credit):</p>

                <p><strong>You learned the science behind the magic.</strong></p>

                <p>The Silva Method isn't woo-woo. It's neuroscience. You discovered that your brain isn't just a thinking machine—it's literally a manifestation technology. You learned to drop into Alpha state, where your subconscious mind becomes programmable. Where what seems impossible in Beta suddenly becomes... normal.</p>

                <p>I'll never forget when José Silva first taught me this. I was sitting in a seminar room in Austin, Texas, thinking, "There's no way I can actually control my brainwave states." Ten minutes later, I was in Alpha, and my entire reality shifted. That's what you just experienced.</p>

                <p><strong>You cleared the blocks.</strong></p>

                <p>Remember all those stories you carried? The ones about not being worthy enough, smart enough, deserving enough? The ones that said "people like me don't get to have that"?</p>

                <p>You didn't just acknowledge them. You dissolved them.</p>

                <p>Layer by layer, call by call, you peeled back years—sometimes decades—of conditioning. And underneath all that noise, you found the truth: <em>There was never anything wrong with you.</em></p>

                <p><strong>You set impossible goals... and watched them show up.</strong></p>

                <p>Remember that thing you wanted when you started? The one that felt too big, too far away, too unrealistic?</p>

                <p>Where is it now?</p>

                <p>Look around. Look at what you've created. The Universe didn't just hear you—it responded. Because you finally learned the language it speaks.</p>

                <p><strong>You built your intuition.</strong></p>

                <p>This one's my favorite. You learned to trust that inner voice. That gut feeling. That knowing that can't be explained rationally but is somehow never wrong.</p>

                <p>You stopped needing to figure everything out with your logical mind. You learned to tune in instead.</p>

                <p>(Side note: This skill alone will change the trajectory of your entire life. Trust me on this.)</p>

                <p><strong>You found your tribe.</strong></p>

                <p>The late-night calls. The vulnerable shares in the group chat. The moment someone posted "IT HAPPENED!" and we all celebrated like it was our own win.</p>

                <p>You didn't do this alone. You rose together.</p>

                <p>And that's what makes this certification real. It's not just a piece of paper. It's your results. Your energy. The person you've become.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>Here's the thing though...</strong></p>

                <p>Graduation isn't the end. It's a portal.</p>

                <p>You didn't spend five months learning to manifest just so you could go back to your normal life and occasionally think positive thoughts. You learned these tools because you're meant to <em>live</em> from this frequency.</p>

                <p>The training wheels are off now.</p>

                <p>You know how to access Alpha. You know how to clear resistance. You know how to trust your intuition, set powerful goals, and hold your vision even when reality hasn't caught up yet.</p>

                <p>So here's the question I want you to sit with:</p>

                <p><strong>What are you going to do with this power?</strong></p>

                <p>Are you going to play small? Make incremental improvements? Keep this beautiful gift to yourself?</p>

                <p>Or are you going to step fully into the life you came here to live—the relationship, the impact, the freedom, the version of you that's been waiting on the other side of fear?</p>

                <p>Because here's what I've noticed over the years:</p>

                <p>Some people take these tools and quietly transform their lives. They manifest the love, the abundance, the peace they've always wanted. And that's beautiful.</p>

                <p>Some people become coaches, teachers, guides. They help others unlock the same power they discovered. They turn their transformation into a movement.</p>

                <p>Some people build businesses, write books, create art, serve in ways they can't even imagine yet.</p>

                <p><strong>All of them carry this frequency forward.</strong></p>

                <p>And everyone they touch feels it—even if they don't know why.</p>

                <p>Look, Regan and I didn't teach you how to manifest.</p>

                <p>You already knew how. You've been doing it your whole life—you just weren't doing it <em>consciously.</em></p>

                <p>We simply reminded you of who you are: a powerful creator, designed by the Universe itself, with infinite potential encoded in your DNA.</p>

                <p>(Yeah, I know that sounds big. But it's also just... true.)</p>

                <p>Thank you for showing up. For doing the work. For believing even when it was hard. For being brave enough to want more.</p>

                <p>This graduation isn't goodbye.</p>

                <p>It's welcome home—to the version of you who was always meant to emerge.</p>

                <p>Now go. Manifest boldly. Live unapologetically.</p>

                <p>And when someone asks you how you did it, just smile and say:</p>

                <p><em>"I remembered who I am."</em></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 40px;">With so much love and respect for your journey,</p>

                <p><strong>Vishen</strong><br>(and Regan, and the entire Manifesting Mastery team)</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 25px; font-style: italic; color: #8A2BE2; font-size: 18px;">✨ You are a manifestation master. Act like it.</p>

                <p>You know that moment?</p>

                <p>When something you manifested—something you focused on, visualized, aligned with—actually showed up in your reality?</p>

                <p>Maybe it was small at first. A parking space. A phone call. A synchronicity that made you pause and think, <em>"Wait... did I just create that?"</em></p>

                <p>Then it got bigger. An opportunity. A relationship. A breakthrough that changed everything.</p>

                <p>And somewhere along the way, you stopped asking <em>if</em> manifestation works.</p>

                <p>You started asking: <strong>What else is possible?</strong></p>

                <p>Here's what I've noticed about Manifesting Mastery graduates:</p>

                <p>At some point, you don't just want this for yourself anymore.</p>

                <p>You want to guide others through their own awakening. You want to hold space for their transformations. You want to help someone else experience that moment when they realize: <em>Holy shit, I created this.</em></p>

                <p>Sound familiar?</p>

                <p><strong>If so, you're being called to become a manifesting coach.</strong></p>

                <p>Not in theory. Not "someday when I'm ready." But as a certified professional with the frameworks, credibility, and community to build a thriving practice around your purpose.</p>

                <p>Which is why I wanted to reach out to you personally.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>On <strong>January 17-19, 2025</strong>, Regan and I are bringing together 40 people in Sevilla, Spain for an intimate 3-day immersion + 2-month certification to become Mindvalley Certified Manifesting Coaches.</p>

                <p>This isn't a massive conference. It's not a webinar. It's a curated experience for people like you—who've done the inner work, who understand the principles, and who are ready to step into their calling as professional guides.</p>

                <p>Here's what makes this different from every other coaching certification out there:</p>

                <p><strong>You'll learn frameworks you won't find anywhere else.</strong></p>

                <p>Not just "how to be a coach" (boring). But how to guide someone through the specific blocks that keep them stuck in patterns of lack. How to help them access Alpha. How to facilitate breakthroughs that stick.</p>

                <p>The methods Regan and I have used to coach thousands of people to life-changing results—we're handing you the entire playbook.</p>

                <p><strong>You'll graduate with a complete system to enroll and transform clients.</strong></p>

                <p>We're not just teaching you coaching. We're teaching you how to build a sustainable practice. Client enrollment. Pricing. Positioning. The business side that nobody talks about but everyone needs.</p>

                <p>(Fun fact: 92% of our certified coaches launch their practice within 90 days. Most coaching certifications don't even track this.)</p>

                <p><strong>You'll join an elite network earning real money.</strong></p>

                <p>We now have 347+ certified coaches worldwide. They're not doing this as a hobby. Average income in year one: $8,500/month. Some are doing multiple six figures.</p>

                <p>But more importantly—they're doing work that actually matters.</p>

                <p><strong>You'll have Mindvalley's backing.</strong></p>

                <p>When you tell someone you're a Mindvalley Certified Manifesting Coach, it means something. We've spent 20 years building credibility in this space. That credibility becomes yours.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Look, here's the reality:</p>

                <p>Within 24 hours of announcing this, 30% of the spots were claimed. I'm not saying this to create fake urgency. I'm saying it because it's true.</p>

                <p>If you're feeling the call—even if it scares you a little—I want to make sure you have all the details before spots fill up.</p>

                <p><a href="#">Learn more about the Sevilla certification here →</a></p>

                <p>To your next chapter,</p>

                <p><strong>Vishen</strong></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><strong>P.S.</strong> If you're thinking "I'm not ready" or "Who am I to be a coach?"... that's exactly the kind of person we want in Sevilla. The best coaches are the ones who remember what it's like to struggle. Who've walked the path themselves. That's you.</p>

            <div class="copyable-content">
                <p>Quick update on the Sevilla certification:</p>

                <p>We're down to <strong>12 spots.</strong></p>

                <p>I wasn't sure how this would go when we first announced it. 40 people. Spain. January. A big commitment.</p>

                <p>But the response has been... honestly, overwhelming.</p>

                <p>Coaches flying in from Singapore. Brazil. The UK. Australia. People rearranging their entire January because they know—in their gut—that this is what they're meant to do next.</p>

                <p>Someone messaged me yesterday and said: <em>"I've been waiting for this my entire life. I just didn't know it until I saw the page."</em></p>

                <p>That hit me.</p>

                <p>Because that's exactly how I felt when I first discovered this work.</p>

                <hr>

                <p>Here's what I think is happening:</p>

                <p><strong>Most coaching certifications teach you theory.</strong> How to ask questions. How to "hold space." Generic frameworks that feel empty.</p>

                <p><strong>This certification teaches you transformation.</strong></p>

                <p>You're not learning to parrot techniques back to people. You're learning to guide them through the specific blocks that keep them stuck. To help them recognize their own power. To facilitate the kind of breakthroughs that change lives.</p>

                <p>And you're learning from two people who've mastered this at the highest level:</p>

                <p><strong>Regan Hillyer</strong> went from broke to building an 8-figure manifestation coaching business in three years. She knows how to do this—and more importantly, she knows how to teach it.</p>

                <p><strong>And me?</strong> I've been studying consciousness and human potential for over 25 years. I've worked with hundreds of thousands of people across 195 countries. I've made every mistake you can make in this space. (Trust me, I've made them all.)</p>

                <p>We're bringing our complete playbooks to Sevilla. The frameworks. The client enrollment systems. The coaching methodologies that actually work.</p>

                <p>But here's what makes this truly special:</p>

                <p><strong>The 3-day immersion isn't just training. It's initiation.</strong></p>

                <p>You'll be in one of the most magical cities in Europe, surrounded by 39 other people who are as committed as you are. You'll practice on each other. You'll breakthrough together. You'll leave transformed—not just educated.</p>

                <p>Then comes the 2-month certification where you'll:</p>

                <p>• Practice with real clients (we'll show you exactly how to enroll them)<br>
                • Get personalized feedback on your coaching from Regan and me<br>
                • Build your complete offer, pricing, and positioning<br>
                • Graduate with a certification backed by Mindvalley's 20-year reputation</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>Here's what our graduates are saying:</strong></p>

                <p><em>"I signed my first $5K client in week 3 of the certification. By month 6, I was fully booked."</em> – Sarah M.</p>

                <p><em>"This wasn't just a certification. It was the permission I needed to step into my purpose."</em> – James T.</p>

                <p><em>"I'd taken three other coaching courses. None of them compared to this."</em> – Priya K.</p>

                <p>This works. And it could work for you.</p>

                <p>But you need to decide soon.</p>

                <p>At this pace, we'll be fully booked within the week.</p>

                <p>I have something for you.</p>

                <p>But first, let me be straight:</p>

                <p><strong>Sevilla is almost full.</strong></p>

                <p>We started with 40 spots. We're down to the final handful. And the application deadline is December 15th.</p>

                <p>If you've been on the fence about becoming a Mindvalley Certified Manifesting Coach, this is your moment.</p>

                <p>Here's why:</p>

                <p>Yesterday, I told my team: <em>"I want to do something special for our Manifesting Mastery graduates. They're already part of our community. Let's honor that."</em></p>

                <p>So we're offering a <strong>Black Friday early-bird discount</strong> exclusively for people like you who've completed Manifesting Mastery.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>Here's the deal:</strong></p>

                <p>The full investment for the Sevilla Certification is <strong>$10,000</strong>.</p>

                <p>That includes everything:</p>

                <p>• 3-day immersion in Sevilla with Regan and me<br>
                • 2-month certification program with live coaching and feedback<br>
                • Lifetime access to all materials and frameworks<br>
                • Mindvalley's official coaching certification<br>
                • Elite network of 347+ certified coaches worldwide</p>

                <p>But if you pay in full by <strong>December 1st</strong>, you'll receive the Black Friday early-bird discount as a thank you for being part of our community.</p>

                <p>Why am I telling you this now?</p>

                <p>Because I don't want you to miss this opportunity for the wrong reasons.</p>

                <p>Not because you don't want it.<br>
                Not because you're not ready.<br>
                But because you waited and the spots filled up.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>Here's what I know about you:</strong></p>

                <p>You completed Manifesting Mastery. You did the work. You showed up for your transformation.</p>

                <p>Which means you're exactly the kind of person who could change lives as a professional coach.</p>

                <p>You have a choice to make:</p>

                <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Keep this beautiful practice to yourself. Use it in your own life. Watch the magic unfold for you alone.</p>

                <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Step into the role you're being called to. Learn to guide others. Build a practice around your purpose. Make a living helping people remember who they really are.</p>

                <p>Neither is wrong.</p>

                <p>But only one leads to Sevilla.</p>

                <hr>

                <p><strong>The application deadline is December 15th.</strong><br>
                <strong>The Black Friday discount ends December 1st.</strong><br>
                <strong>And spots are filling as we speak.</strong></p>

                <p>If you're feeling the call—even if it scares you a little—I encourage you to take the next step.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>P.S.</strong> Still unsure? Here's my litmus test: If you were sitting across from someone who desperately needed guidance with manifestation, and you <em>knew</em> you could help them... would you?</p>

                <p>If the answer is yes, you're ready. The rest is just learning the frameworks. And that's exactly what we'll teach you in Sevilla.</p>
