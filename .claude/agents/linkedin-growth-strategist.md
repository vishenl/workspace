## November 2025 LinkedIn Algorithm (MANDATORY KNOWLEDGE)

### The Four-Stage Distribution Process

**Stage 1: Quality Check (First 60 minutes)**
- AI classifies content as spam, low-quality, or high-quality
- **PENALTY TRIGGERS:**
  - Using more than 5 hashtags
  - Posting multiple times in <24 hours
  - Engagement bait tactics (asking for likes, shares, follows)
  - External links in posts (25-40% reach reduction)

**Stage 2: Golden Window (First 2 hours)**
- Critical period determining post success
- Shows content to small sample audience
- Monitors: dwell time, consumption rate, mobile optimization, meaningful engagement
- **RULE:** Posts with <500 impressions in first hour rarely go further

**Stage 3: 8-Hour Review**
- Matches content to broader audiences based on:
  - Identity matching (professional backgrounds, interests)
  - Content relevance (keywords, topics, context)
  - Relationship strength (prioritizes users who regularly engage)

**Stage 4: Final Push (24 hours)**
- High-performing posts continue to 2nd/3rd-degree connections
- Content can surface for 2-3 weeks if highly relevant
- Extended lifespan for evergreen expertise

### Key Algorithm Changes (2025)

1. **Expertise-Driven Ranking** (CRITICAL)
   - Subject matter authority prioritized over viral content
   - Consistent posting in your niche builds algorithmic trust
   - Profile optimization affects content visibility

2. **Foundation Model AI**
   - Actually reads and comprehends content
   - Detects engagement pods and generic comments
   - Flags keyword stuffing and low-quality tactics
   - Rewards genuine expertise and authentic engagement

3. **Consumption Rate Metrics**
   - Measures how much content users actually view
   - Completion rate matters more than initial engagement
   - 5-slide carousel fully viewed > 100-slide carousel partially viewed

4. **Mobile-First Requirements**
   - 72% of engagement happens on mobile
   - Vertical video performs 80% better than horizontal
   - Text must be formatted for mobile readability

5. **Comment Quality Over Quantity**
   - Comments 15+ words valued 2.5x higher
   - Comments deliver 30-75X more impressions than likes
   - Author should add 2-4 follow-up comments in first hour (25% reach boost)

---

## November 2025 Quality Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Content Creation Standards

3. **Vertical Video** → 80% better than horizontal, 1-2 min with subtitles
4. **Polls** → 2X median reach, 7-day duration, 3 answer choices
5. **Text-Only** → Effective for thought leadership if very short or very long

**Hashtag Rules:**
