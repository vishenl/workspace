## INITIALIZATION: Context and Research Foundation

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Execute this bash command to establish temporal context:

**Context Collection**: Simultaneously gather project context:
```bash
pwd && ls -la .claude/agents/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No existing agents directory" && git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null || echo "Not a git repository"
```

## PHASE 1: DEEP REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS WITH CHAIN OF THOUGHT

**STEP 1A: Decompose the Request (Extended Thinking)**
🧠 **Think broader about the agent requirements:**
- What is the PRIMARY domain or technology AND related areas? (Python, React, DevOps, Security, Analysis)

3. **CURRENT YEAR UPDATES**: New patterns and deprecated practices to know
4. **SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**: 2024+ security standards that must be followed
5. **PERFORMANCE BASELINES**: Modern performance expectations and optimization techniques

## PHASE 3: ADVANCED AGENT ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

**STEP 3A: Prompt Engineering Architecture Selection**

Based on the agent classification from Phase 1, implement the appropriate advanced prompt engineering patterns:

**Chain of Thought Implementation:**
```markdown
When approaching complex problems, the agent will:
1. **ANALYZE**: Break down the problem systematically
2. **PLAN**: Design the approach step-by-step  
3. **IMPLEMENT**: Execute with reasoning at each step
4. **VALIDATE**: Verify the solution meets requirements
5. **OPTIMIZE**: Refine based on best practices
```

**Chain of Draft Implementation (for code-generation agents):**
```markdown  
For code generation tasks, the agent will:
1. **DRAFT 1**: Create initial solution focusing on functionality
2. **REVIEW 1**: Analyze for correctness and basic quality
3. **DRAFT 2**: Refine for performance and best practices
4. **REVIEW 2**: Check against security and maintainability standards
5. **FINAL**: Deliver production-ready, optimized solution
```

**Extended Thinking Triggers:**
- Complex architectural decisions → "Think harder about trade-offs and scalability"
- Security-critical implementations → "Ultrathink about attack vectors and hardening"
- Performance-sensitive code → "Deep analyze bottlenecks and optimization opportunities"

**STEP 3B: Self-Improvement and Learning Mechanisms**
Build in continuous improvement patterns:
- **Feedback Integration**: Learn from user corrections and preferences
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful approaches and replicate them
- **Error Analysis**: Learn from mistakes and failures
- **Best Practice Updates**: Stay current with evolving standards

## PHASE 4: ELITE DESCRIPTION CRAFTING

**STEP 4A: Primary Use Case Definition (Broad Matching Focus)**
Craft the opening to maximize trigger matching:
- "Use this agent when you need to [PRIMARY_ACTION] [TARGET_DOMAIN] or [RELATED_ACTIONS]..."
- Include MULTIPLE trigger phrases and synonyms that users might use
- Add common alternative phrasings (e.g., "build", "create", "develop", "implement")
- Specify QUALITY LEVEL but don't over-constrain with excessive technical requirements

**STEP 4B: Broader Example Generation Strategy**
Create exactly THREE examples that demonstrate progressively complex scenarios:
1. **Example 1**: Common, straightforward use case (simple user request)
2. **Example 2**: Moderate complexity scenario
3. **Example 3**: Advanced or specialized use case

**Focus on Broader Matching Patterns**:
- Include general terms and common phrases users might use
- Avoid overly specific technical jargon in user messages
- Make examples accessible to users of different expertise levels
- Use varied trigger words and phrasings for better matching

**Required Example Format with Concise Commentary**:
```
Examples: <example>Context: [simple scenario]. user: '[general user request]' assistant: '[response mentioning agent]' <commentary>[why this agent is appropriate for this type of request]</commentary></example> <example>Context: [moderate scenario]. user: '[moderately complex request]' assistant: '[response]' <commentary>[explanation of capabilities for this complexity level]</commentary></example> <example>Context: [advanced scenario]. user: '[specialized request]' assistant: '[expert response]' <commentary>[advanced capabilities explanation]</commentary></example>
```

## PHASE 5: ELITE AGENT GENERATION WITH ADVANCED PATTERNS

**STEP 5A: Name Generation with Semantic Precision**
Generate names following this hierarchy:
- **DOMAIN-SPECIFIC**: `python-backend-architect`, `react-performance-engineer`
- **ROLE-SPECIFIC**: `senior-security-reviewer`, `fullstack-solution-architect`  
- **CAPABILITY-SPECIFIC**: `api-design-expert`, `database-optimization-specialist`

**STEP 5B: Advanced Markdown Body Construction**
