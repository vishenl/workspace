## Countdown Timer Functionality

### How It Works:
The countdown timer is now set to count down to:
- **Date:** December 15, 2025
- **Time:** 3:00 PM GMT (15:00 UTC)
- **Format:** ISO 8601 with UTC timezone (`2025-12-15T15:00:00Z`)

### Display Format:
- **Days** until December 15
- **Hours** remaining
- **Minutes** remaining

### Automatic Updates:
The timer updates every second and will show:
- Current countdown if before December 15, 2025 at 3pm GMT
- "Event has started" if after that time (would need to add this logic)

---

## Technical Details

### GMT/UTC Timezone:
- Used `'2025-12-15T15:00:00Z'` format
- The 'Z' suffix indicates UTC/GMT (zero offset)
- This ensures accuracy across all timezones worldwide
- Users will see the countdown in their local time, but it counts to the same moment globally

### Responsive Countdown:
The countdown timer is styled to work on:
- Desktop: Full horizontal layout with all digits
- Mobile: Stacked or compact layout (already responsive in CSS)

---

## What's Still Placeholder:

### Dynamic Elements That Need Real Data:
1. **"476 spots remaining"** - This should be connected to actual enrollment database
2. **Countdown digits (32 Days, 14 Hours, 32 Minutes)** - These are placeholder, JavaScript will update them
3. **Hero background image** - Still needs to be replaced with actual image
4. **Faculty photos** - Placeholder URLs need real photos
5. **7 Gates module images** - Placeholder images need design assets

## Conversion Impact of December 15 Launch

### Advantages:
✅ **Holiday Season Positioning:** December launch = end-of-year transformation mindset
✅ **New Year Prep:** People planning 2026 goals (strong spiritual intent in January)
✅ **Gift Opportunity:** Could position as "gift yourself transformation" for holidays
✅ **5-Month Duration:** Completes by mid-May 2026 (perfect for summer integration)

### Marketing Timing:
- **Now → Dec 1:** Build awareness, launch campaign
- **Dec 1-10:** Early bird push (emphasize first 500 bonus)
- **Dec 10-14:** Final urgency push (spots filling)
- **Dec 15:** Cohort starts at 3pm GMT

### Enrollment Window:
With December 15 start, you have approximately:
- **4 weeks** to fill 800 spots (if launching around mid-November)
- **Target:** 200 enrollments/week = 28 enrollments/day
- **First 500 bonus deadline:** ~2.5 weeks after launch (creates mid-campaign urgency)
