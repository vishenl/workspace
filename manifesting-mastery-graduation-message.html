         YOUR JOURNEY SECTION
         ============================================ -->
    <section>
        <div class="container">
            <p>Five months ago, you walked into this program with dreams, doubts, and a whisper of possibility. Maybe you weren't sure if manifestation was real. Maybe you'd tried before and "failed." Maybe you just knew, deep down, that there had to be more.</p>

            <p>Today, you stand on the other side—not as the person who hoped manifestation might work, but as someone who <strong>knows</strong> it does. Because you've lived it.</p>

            <div class="achievement-card">
                <p><strong>You've learned the science.</strong> The Silva Method showed you that your mind is not just a thinking machine—it's a manifestation technology. You learned to drop into Alpha, to program your subconscious, to operate from a frequency where miracles are normal.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-card">
                <p><strong>You've cleared the blocks.</strong> Those old stories about worthiness, about money, about what's possible for "someone like you"? You didn't just acknowledge them. You <em>dissolved</em> them. Layer by layer, call by call, you peeled back the conditioning until you could finally see the truth: there was never anything wrong with you.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-card">
                <p><strong>You've set impossible goals—and watched them materialize.</strong> Remember that thing you wanted when this started? The one that felt too big, too far, too unrealistic? Look at where you are now. Look at what you've created. The Universe didn't just hear you. It <em>responded</em>.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-card">
                <p><strong>You've built your intuition.</strong> You've learned to trust that inner voice, that gut feeling, that knowing that can't be explained but is never wrong. You've discovered that you don't need to figure everything out—you just need to tune in.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="achievement-card">
                <p><strong>You've connected with your tribe.</strong> The late-night group calls. The vulnerable shares. The celebrations in the chat when someone's manifestation landed. You didn't just learn alone—you rose together.</p>
            </div>

            <p>And now? Now you're certified. Not by a piece of paper, but by your <strong>results</strong>. By your energy. By the person you've become.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Graduation is not a destination. It's a portal.</p>

            <p>You didn't spend five months learning to manifest so you could go back to your old life and think happy thoughts occasionally. You learned these tools because you're meant to <strong>live</strong> from this frequency. To become the person who manifests consistently, effortlessly, joyfully.</p>

            <p>The training wheels are off now. You know how to access Alpha. You know how to clear resistance. You know how to trust your intuition, set powerful goals, and hold your vision even when reality hasn't caught up yet.</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>The question is: What will you do with this power?</strong></p>
            </div>

            <p>Will you go small, settling for incremental improvements? Or will you finally claim the life you came here to live—the relationship, the income, the impact, the freedom, the <em>version of you</em> that's been waiting on the other side of fear?</p>

            <p>Some of you will build businesses, write books, create art, or serve in ways you can't even imagine yet.</p>

            <p>Thank you for showing up. For doing the work. For believing even when it was hard. For being brave enough to want more.</p>

            <p>This graduation isn't goodbye. It's <strong>welcome home</strong>—to the version of you who was always meant to emerge.</p>

            <p>Now go. Manifest boldly. Live unapologetically. And when someone asks how you did it, smile and say:</p>
