## Key Trends & Patterns

### 1. **PACE & DELIVERY SPEED (Critical Issue)**

**Trend:** One of the most consistent complaints across multiple teachers

**Student Quotes:**

- "Very difficult to follow - everything sooo fast" - Rating 8/10

- "Absolutely amazing content, but presented at a pace that assumes quite advanced skills and knowledge of AI" - Rating 7/10
- "Very fascinating! I am finding it hard to follow along and grasp everything because there is so much great information" - Rating 7/10

**Teachers Affected:**
- Vishen Lakhiani (primary concern)
- Daniel Priestley
- Multiple sessions

**Impact:** Students feeling overwhelmed, unable to follow along in real-time, missing key concepts

---

### 2. **BEGINNER VS. ADVANCED ASSUMPTION GAP**

**Trend:** Content assumes higher level of knowledge than many students possess

**Student Quotes:**
- "I have no website yet. I am a beginner and I expected more support around how to create your business from scratch as a first-time entrepreneur" - Rating 6/10
- "I am questioning if I have been wise to join. I am sure the content is good, but alot goes over my head" - Rating 4/10
- "For those of us that don't have a strong AI experience set (like myself), it was difficult to understand and keep pace" - Rating 9/10
- "There was quite a bit of overwhelming information for myself a new aspiring entrepreneur" - Rating 10/10
- "Very insightful, not totally clear on the steps to follow if i dont have a business yet, and still working through that" - Rating 8/10

**Gap Identified:** Curriculum assumes participants already have:
- An existing business
- Basic AI/tech literacy
- Foundational entrepreneurship knowledge
- Employees or team members

**Reality:** Many students are:
- First-time entrepreneurs
- Idea-stage only
- No technical background
- Solo entrepreneurs without teams

---

### 3. **RESOURCE & MATERIAL ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES**

**Trend:** Students struggling to access materials during and after sessions

**Student Quotes:**
- "Wow - Again, love Vishen!!!! Yet, I wonder why a company that prides itself on tech couldn't seem to share copies of Google Docs in a way that allows us to do what he suggested" - Rating 8/10
- "It would be nice to be able to get the slides ahead of the live class so we can print them out and make notes" - Rating 9/10
- "The prompts were not included in the resources, so that would have been nice. I took screen shots because the replays do NOT offer the chat view" - Rating 10/10

- Downloadable resources have errors
- AI prompts not included in resources
- Recording access unclear

---

### 4. **PLATFORM & TECHNICAL FRUSTRATIONS**

**Trend:** The webinar/app platform creating barriers to engagement

**Student Quotes:**
- "There was an issue again with links in the MV app. This seems to be an ongoing issue across the Mastery classes" - Rating 10/10
- "The app used for the webinar doesn't allow switching to another page — the sound immediately cuts off — and the chat is very confusing" - Rating 7/10
- "I still wish we were using the zoom platform to be interactive not just as a webinar. It was be so powerful to be connecting with other entrepreneurs that are in resonance live and engaging" - Rating 10/10
- "Would be great if it wasn't webinar style so that we can be more interactive, that's how he usually does his workshops and it works really well!" - Rating 7/10 (about Daniel Priestley)
- "This format allows all the participants to interact and get to know each other and support directly with personal solutions. I would support that this is the format used for all the Entrepreneur Mastery calls" - Rating 10/10 (praising Ajit's interactive Zoom format)

**Student Preference:** Interactive Zoom > Webinar-style format

**Reason:** Students want:
- To see who's attending

### 5. **DESIRE FOR MORE "HOW-TO" & ACTIONABLE STEPS**

**Trend:** Students appreciate frameworks but want more tactical implementation guidance

- "Would have liked to learn the easiest way to create the web site if you didn´t have one yet" - Rating 8/10

**What Students Want:**
- Templates they can use immediately
- Step-by-step guides
- Example scripts/emails

## Final Thoughts

You have **exceptional content and exceptional teachers**. The gap is not in quality but in **delivery pace, resource accessibility, and beginner support**.

Your highest-rated teachers (Ajit, Shadé) share common traits:
- **Clear, not rushed**
- **Warm and approachable**
- **Actionable, not just inspirational**
- **Patient with beginners**

By slowing down, providing better resources, and creating more interactive experiences, you can transform good ratings (7-8) into exceptional ones (9-10) across the board.

Students are not asking for less content - they're asking for **more time to absorb it** and **better tools to implement it**.
