## CLASS STRUCTURE (75 Minutes Core + 15 Minutes Q&A)

### PART 1: THE NEW RULES OF BUILDING (10 minutes)

**Opening Hook (2 minutes)**
- Story: "Three months ago, Sarah, a 52-year-old wellness coach, had an idea for a meditation app. She had no coding skills. Today, her app has 10,000 users. Here's what changed..."
- Bold statement: "In 2025, the ability to code is becoming LESS important for entrepreneurs, not more. Let me show you why."

**Core Teaching (8 minutes)**
- **The Old Way vs. The New Way** (3 min)
  - Old: Write code → Learn syntax → Debug errors → Weeks of learning
  - New: Describe what you want → AI builds it → You guide with vision → Hours to results

- **The Vibe Coding Mindset** (3 min)
  - You're the architect, AI is the construction crew
  - Your superpower: Clear vision + knowing what to ask for
  - The 80/20 rule: Focus on what matters to customers, not perfect code

- **Three Real Examples** (2 min)
  - Landing page: Idea to live site in 2 hours (fitness studio owner, age 47)
  - Booking system: MVP in one weekend (consultant, age 55)
  - E-commerce prototype: Product validation in 3 days (product creator, age 43)

**Mindset Anchors to Emphasize:**
- "You don't need to understand the engine to drive the car"
- "Your business wisdom is MORE valuable than technical knowledge"
- "Perfectionism kills entrepreneurship. Shipped beats perfect."

**Discussion Prompt:** "In chat, type ONE digital thing you've been wanting to build but felt was 'too technical'"

---

### PART 2: THE VIBE CODING TOOLKIT (8 minutes)

**Core Teaching (8 minutes)**

**The Three-Tool Stack** (5 min)
1. **AI Coding Assistants** (Claude Code, Cursor, v0, Bolt.new)
   - What they do: Turn your descriptions into working code
   - When to use: Building actual functionality
   - Cost: $20-40/month (less than one hour of developer time)

2. **No-Code Platforms** (Framer, Webflow, Carrd)
   - What they do: Visual website building with AI enhancement
   - When to use: Marketing sites, landing pages, portfolios
   - Cost: $10-30/month

3. **AI Enhancement Tools** (ChatGPT for content, Midjourney for images)
   - What they do: Generate copy, images, and assets
   - When to use: Supporting your builds with content
   - Cost: $20-30/month

**The Decision Framework** (3 min)
- Need it TODAY? → No-code platform (Carrd + ChatGPT)
- Need custom functionality? → AI coding assistant (Claude Code/Cursor)
- Need to validate idea fast? → Combine both (landing page + simple backend)

**Visual Aid to Show:**
```
PROJECT TYPE               BEST TOOL           TIME TO LAUNCH
Landing page              Carrd/Framer         2-4 hours
Portfolio website         Webflow/Framer       4-8 hours
Booking/scheduling        Cursor + templates   1-2 days
Simple e-commerce         Cursor + Stripe      2-3 days
Custom app MVP            Claude Code          3-7 days
```

---

### PART 3: LIVE BUILD - LANDING PAGE IN 15 MINUTES (22 minutes)

**Setup (2 minutes)**
- "We're going to build a landing page for a fictional business: 'Mindful Mornings' - a 5-day meditation challenge for busy entrepreneurs"
- Share screen with Cursor/Claude Code open
- Emphasize: "Watch HOW I communicate with the AI, not the technical details"

**Live Demonstration (15 minutes)**

**Step 1: The Vision Prompt** (3 min)
- Show the prompt structure:
  ```
  I need a landing page for [business idea]

  Target audience: [who they are]
  Main problem it solves: [pain point]
  Key features: [3-4 bullet points]
  Call to action: [what you want them to do]
  Vibe/style: [emotional tone, visual style]

  Include: Hero section, benefits, testimonials placeholder,
  email signup form, footer with social links
  ```

- Type this live, explaining each part
- Hit enter and show AI generating code in real-time

**Step 2: The Iteration Dance** (7 min)
- AI generates initial version → Review together
- Make requests: "Make the headline bigger and more bold"
- Request: "Change the color scheme to calming blues and whites"
- Request: "Add a section showing the 5-day curriculum"
- Show how to give feedback in plain English
- Emphasize: "Notice I'm not touching code. I'm just describing what I want."

**Step 3: Publishing** (3 min)
- Show deploying to Netlify/Vercel (one-click publish)
- Live site appears with custom URL
- "From idea to live website in 15 minutes. No coding."

**Step 4: The Business Layer** (2 min)
- Connect email form to Mailchimp/ConvertKit (show AI doing it)
- Add Google Analytics tracking code (AI adds it)
- "Now you're collecting leads and tracking visitors. Your business is live."

**Teaching Points During Demo:**
- "See how I described the outcome, not the technical steps?"
- "When it's not quite right, I just ask for changes in plain English"
- "Mistakes are fast to fix - just describe what you want different"
- "This is YOUR design sense + AI's technical execution"

---

### PART 4: BEYOND LANDING PAGES - THE POSSIBILITIES (10 minutes)

**Core Teaching (7 minutes)**

**Real Entrepreneurial Use Cases** (5 min)

1. **Customer Validation Tools**
   - Waitlist pages with payment capture
   - Survey/feedback forms with custom logic
   - Prototype demos to test interest
   - *Example*: "Test if people will pay BEFORE you build the full product"

2. **Business Operations**
   - Client onboarding forms with automation
   - Booking/scheduling systems
   - Custom calculators (pricing, ROI, etc.)
   - Internal dashboards for tracking metrics
   - *Example*: "A coaching business built their entire client intake system in a weekend"

3. **MVP Apps** (Minimum Viable Product)
   - Simple web apps to test business models
   - Community/membership portals
   - Course delivery platforms
   - Marketplace prototypes
   - *Example*: "Test your app idea with 100 real users before investing $50k in development"

**The Build-Measure-Learn Loop** (2 min)
```
Traditional: Idea → Hire developer → 3 months → Launch → Learn (slow)
Vibe Coding: Idea → Build in days → Launch → Learn → Iterate (fast)
```
- Speed of learning = competitive advantage
- Fail fast, succeed faster
- Your competition is still in the hiring phase

**Interactive Element:**
"Think of your current business idea. In the chat, share: What's ONE thing you could build THIS WEEK to test it?"

---

### PART 5: THE ENTREPRENEURIAL FRAMEWORK (15 minutes)

**Core Teaching (12 minutes)**

**The 4-Step Vibe Coding Process** (6 min)

**Step 1: Clarity Before Code** (90 seconds)
- Define: What problem does this solve?
- Identify: Who is this for specifically?
- Determine: What's the ONE action you want them to take?
- Sketch: Draw it on paper first (yes, paper!)
- *Common Mistake*: Starting to build before clarity = wasted time

**Step 2: Start with the Simplest Version** (90 seconds)
- What's the absolute minimum to test your idea?
- Cut features ruthlessly for version 1
- Example: "Landing page + email signup" beats "full app with 47 features"
- You can add complexity after validation
- *Common Mistake*: Over-building before you have customers

**Step 3: Communicate in Outcomes** (90 seconds)
- Bad prompt: "Make a website"
- Good prompt: "Create a landing page that converts wellness coaches into email subscribers by highlighting my 5-day meditation challenge and showing social proof"
- The more specific your vision, the better the result
- Include: audience, purpose, action, vibe
- *Pro Tip*: Look at websites you love, describe them to AI, ask it to create similar vibe

**Step 4: Iterate Based on Real Feedback** (90 seconds)
- Launch fast, gather data
- User feedback > your assumptions
- Use AI to make changes quickly based on what you learn
- Example: "Users confused by pricing? Ask AI to redesign that section."
- Speed of iteration = learning velocity

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid** (6 min)

**Pitfall 1: Perfectionism Paralysis** (90 seconds)
- *The trap*: "It needs to be perfect before I launch"
- *The reality*: Perfect is the enemy of done
- *The solution*: Ship at 80% ready, improve based on real user feedback
- *Reframe*: "This is version 1.0. Version 2.0 will be better because users will tell me what they need."

**Pitfall 2: Feature Creep** (90 seconds)
- *The trap*: "While I'm building, I should add X, Y, Z features"
- *The reality*: More features = more complexity = slower learning
- *The solution*: Test ONE core value proposition first
- *Example*: "Dropbox launched with just file syncing. That's it. Now look at them."

**Pitfall 3: Technical Rabbit Holes** (90 seconds)
- *The trap*: "I need to understand how this works"
- *The reality*: You're an entrepreneur, not a computer science student
- *The solution*: Focus on outcomes, not implementation
- *Reframe*: "I don't need to know how email servers work to send emails"

**Pitfall 4: Comparison to Big Tech** (90 seconds)
- *The trap*: "This doesn't look like Apple's website"
- *The reality*: Apple has 100-person design teams. You're testing a business idea.
- *The solution*: Compare to other MVPs and early-stage startups
- *Reframe*: "Good enough to get customers is infinitely better than perfect in my head"

**Practice Exercise (3 minutes)**
"Let's practice writing a good prompt together. I'll show one, you try one in chat."

**My Example:**
```
I need a landing page for executive leadership coaching.

Target audience: Mid-level managers (35-50) transitioning to C-suite
Main problem: They have technical skills but lack executive presence
Key features:
- 12-week transformation program
- 1-on-1 coaching + group mastermind
- Focus on communication, strategy, influence
Call to action: Book free 30-minute clarity call
Vibe: Professional but warm, inspiring, premium feel (think navy blue, gold accents)

Include: Hero with powerful headline, my credibility/background,
program overview, testimonials from previous clients, FAQ section,
booking calendar integration
```

**Your Turn:**
"Take 2 minutes. Write a prompt for something YOU want to build. Use the chat. I'll review a few."
- Pick 2-3 from chat to review live
- Point out what's good, what could be more specific
- This solidifies the learning

### PART 7: TRANSFORMATION ANCHORING (5 minutes)

**Closing Reflection (3 minutes)**

**The Bigger Picture** (90 seconds)
- "This isn't really about coding. It's about removing barriers between your vision and reality."
- "Every entrepreneur has ideas that die because 'it's too technical' or 'I can't afford a developer.'"
- "Today, you learned that's no longer true. The only barrier now is taking action."
- "In 2025, resourcefulness beats resources. Speed beats perfection. Done beats perfect."

**Your Identity Shift** (90 seconds)
- Before today: "I'm not technical"
- After today: "I'm a builder. I use AI as my technical partner."
- This isn't about becoming a developer
- This is about becoming UNSTOPPABLE as an entrepreneur
- "You now have a superpower that 90% of your competitors don't know exists"

**Interactive Commitment (2 minutes)**

"I want you to make a commitment to yourself right now."

**Type in chat or say out loud:**
"Within 48 hours, I will build and publish: [your project]"

Examples from previous classes:
- "Landing page for my consulting business"
- "Waitlist page for my course idea"
- "Booking form for my coaching services"
- "Portfolio site to attract speaking gigs"

"Screenshot your commitment. Post it in the community. Tag me. I'll personally check in on your progress."

**Final Inspiration (30 seconds)**
- "Sarah, who I mentioned at the start? She knew nothing about coding. She watched a class like this. She took action. Now she has 10,000 users."
- "The difference between her and everyone else with the same idea? She shipped."
- "You have 48 hours. Go build something amazing."

---

## Q&A SESSION (15 minutes)

**Anticipated Questions & Answers:**

**Q: "I'm 57 and barely understand social media. Can I really do this?"**
**A:** "Yes. Here's why: You're not learning to code, you're learning to communicate what you want. If you can describe your business to another person, you can describe it to AI. Age is irrelevant. Clarity of vision matters."

**Q: "What if I get stuck and the AI doesn't understand me?"**
**A:** "Three strategies: (1) Rephrase your request in simpler terms, (2) Show examples of what you like, (3) Use our community - someone else has solved your exact problem. Also, getting stuck is FAST now - minutes, not days."

**Q: "How much does all this cost?"**
**A:** "Starter tier: $0-50/month for everything you need. Compare to hiring a developer: $5,000-25,000 for a simple website. Or hiring an agency: $10,000-100,000. You're saving 99% of cost for the MVP phase. Invest in developers later when you have revenue."

**Q: "Is this just for websites or can I build actual apps?"**
**A:** "Both. Websites and web apps are immediately possible. Mobile apps take a bit more, but you can build MVPs. Example: A student built a habit-tracking web app in a weekend. 300 people used it. THEN he hired a developer to make it a native mobile app. Validated first, invested second."

**Q: "What if my business idea is complex?"**
**A:** "Start with the simplest version. Airbnb started as air mattresses in their apartment + a basic website. Facebook was just a hot-or-not for Harvard students. Your complex vision can launch as a simple MVP. Test the core value prop first."

**Q: "I tried no-code tools before and got frustrated. How is this different?"**
**A:** "Two differences: (1) AI has gotten 10x better in the last year - it understands context now, (2) You're learning a framework, not just a tool. The 4-step process works regardless of which AI tool you use. Plus, you have community support now."

**Q: "Will AI replace the need for developers entirely?"**
**A:** "No. AI is amazing for MVPs, prototypes, and testing ideas. For complex, scalable applications, you'll still want professional developers. But here's the key: You'll hire them AFTER you've validated your idea and have revenue. You'll also communicate better with them because you understand what's possible."

**Q: "What's the learning curve? How long until I'm comfortable?"**
**A:** "First build: 4-8 hours (including learning). Second build: 2-4 hours. Third build: 1-2 hours. By your 5th project, you'll feel confident. This isn't years of learning - it's days. Follow the 48-hour challenge and you'll see."

## INSTRUCTOR DELIVERY NOTES

### Energy & Pacing
- **High energy for first 20 minutes** - Hook them with possibility
- **Calm, confident during demo** - Show that this is easy
- **Inspiring at close** - Send them out feeling unstoppable
- **Pause for questions throughout** - Don't wait until end
- **Use chat actively** - Acknowledge comments, create interaction

### Language to Use
- "Build" not "code" (identity shift)
- "Your vision" not "technical requirements"
- "Test" not "launch perfectly"
- "Entrepreneur" not "non-technical person" (no deficit framing)
- "Fast" and "simple" repeatedly (combat intimidation)

### Language to Avoid
- Technical jargon (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API, etc.) - unless explaining simply
- "Easy" (implies they should already know) - use "simple" or "straightforward"
- "Just" (minimizes their struggle) - "Here's how" instead of "just do this"
- Ageist assumptions - never reference age as limitation

### Common Sticking Points & How to Address

**If Students Seem Overwhelmed:**
- Pause and acknowledge: "This might feel like a lot. Here's what matters: You don't need to remember everything. You need to remember the FRAMEWORK. Everything else is in the resources."
- Simplify: "Focus on ONE project. Just one. Master that, then expand."

**If Someone Says "I'm Too Old for This":**
- Redirect: "This isn't about age. It's about being willing to learn one new tool. You've learned dozens of tools in your business already - email, accounting software, social media. This is just one more. And it's specifically designed for non-technical people."

**If Demo Has Technical Issues:**
- Stay calm: "Perfect example of real life. When things break, you describe the problem to AI and ask for a fix. Watch..."
- Turn it into teaching moment: Show troubleshooting with AI

**If Students Want to Go Deeper on Code:**
- Redirect: "Great question. The beauty is you don't need to know that. But if you're curious, there are resources in your takeaway guide. For now, let's stay focused on what gets you launched."

### Props/Visual Aids to Prepare
- Before/after website examples (sketches → live sites)
- Cost comparison chart (DIY vs. hiring developers)
- Timeline comparison (traditional vs. vibe coding)
- Example prompts on slides (clear, large text)
- Screenshot of deployed site with URL

## CONCLUSION

This masterclass transforms entrepreneurs from "I need to hire someone" to "I can build this myself to test my idea."

**The Real Transformation:**
- Not about coding → About removing barriers
- Not about technology → About entrepreneurial velocity
- Not about tools → About unstoppable resourcefulness

**Success = Students who:**
1. Ship something within 48 hours
2. Feel empowered instead of dependent
3. Use this skill to validate business ideas faster
4. Move from idea phase to action phase permanently

This curriculum respects their intelligence, honors their time, and delivers immediate business value.

The goal isn't to create developers. It's to create entrepreneurs who are impossible to stop.
