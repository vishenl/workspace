- Life area improvements (relationships, career, health, etc.)

### Business Metrics

---

## CONCLUSION

**The current 22-week structure will not serve your students or business goals.**

You must choose one of these three options:

**Option A** = Optimize for completion (recommended for new Quest launches)
**Option B** = Optimize for revenue and student choice (recommended overall) ⭐
**Option C** = Optimize for comprehensiveness (recommended for premium positioning)

**All three options are superior to the current 22-week structure.**

The question is strategic positioning:
- Do you want highest completion rates? → Option A
- Do you want to serve all student types? → Option B
- Do you want premium comprehensive experience? → Option C

**My recommendation remains Option B** because it:
- Protects completion rate metrics (core 55-65%)
- Preserves your best Month 4 content
- Creates revenue upside
- Empowers student choice
- Builds two celebration moments
- Positions Spiritual Mastery as having tiers (foundation vs mastery)

**Make your decision, then I'll help you build the detailed implementation plan.**
